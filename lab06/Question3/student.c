// Description

// Check whether the graph contains a triangle. A triangle is a set of three nodes that are all connected to each other. 
// The graph is stored as an adjacency matrix. 
// Graph* g is a pointer to a Graph struct, which contains a 2D array adj[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES]. 
// The value at adj[u][v] is 1 if there is an edge between nodes u and v, and 0 otherwise.

int has_triangle(Graph* g) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_NODES; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < MAX_NODES; j++) {
            if (g->adj[i][j] == 1) {  // Edge between i and j
                for (int k = j + 1; k < MAX_NODES; k++) {
                    // Check if k connects to both i and j
                    if (g->adj[i][k] == 1 && g->adj[j][k] == 1) {
                        return 1;  // Found a triangle
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return 0;  // No triangle found
